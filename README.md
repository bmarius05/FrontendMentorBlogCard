## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned how to use difrent flexbox directions. For instance hte image has to be centered but the text and the author should be aligned to the left.

```css
.card{
    background-color: var(--White);
    border-radius: 10px;
    width: 20rem;
    height: 28rem;
    padding: 1rem;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    border: 1px solid var(--Gray-950);
    box-shadow: 4px 4px 0 0 var(--Gray-950);
    overflow: hidden;
}
```

### Continued development
In the future I want to improve my artistic eye to be able to create amazing designs on my own.
